      <p>Software Carpentry training has had a tremendous influence on the
	productivity of the students in my lab and several other labs on campus. It
	trained them to write code that works properly more quickly and to automate
	repetitive tasks that they used to spend hours on (now they spend minutes). In
	addition, we are now reusing code much more often, because the code is written
	in such a way that the students can remember what they did and other students
	can understand exactly how the code works. I can't recommend Software
	Carpentry strongly enough.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="testimonial">
      <p>My labmates and I attended a Software Carpentry bootcamp a few months ago,
	and since then, several graduate students and RAs have been much more willing
	to tackle simple programming tasks independently. We have also now implemented
	a version control repository in the lab: it has greatly reduced the number of
	files flying around and helped to ensure that everyone in the lab has the most
	up-to-date versions of all the code we routinely use. Its history mechanism
	also keeps us from having to manually document every change made or analysis
	done, which has greatly improved our ability to find information quickly.</p>

    <blockquote class="testimonial">
      <p>As a nuclear engineer at the US national labs, the number of nuclear safety
	and performance codes I see which are practically untested, basically
	undocumented, and completely lacking in version control is alarming. New
	projects are starting to incorporate better practices, but over and over
	again, students and new staff members show up ready to implement advanced
	numerical methods but don't have a handle on version control. I've found that
	the time it takes to train new researchers to adopt essential software
	practices is vastly reduced by the bootcamps and online resources provided by
	Software Carpentry. By directing colleagues to the online lectures instead of
	teaching them individually to test and version control their code I've
	personally saved a great number of hours and they've been spared just as many
	false starts.</p>

    <blockquote class="testimonial">
      <p>As a self-taught programmer, Software Carpentry gave me the tools to plan
	better code before even picking up a keyboard&mdash;improving my ability to
	expand, re-use, and test what I develop. The result is a more reliable, better
	traceable product, and I have a better sense of what to look for when
	evaluating other tools.</p>
      <cite>&mdash; Deanna Langer's PhD explored multi-parametric MRI for prostate cancer localization</cite>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="testimonial">
      <p>Armed with a single introductory C++ course, I did a master's degree and
	several years of consulting work on spatial simulation models before taking
	Software Carpentry. Long, slow, frustrating experience left me well prepared
	to appreciate this course. What has changed? I work more quickly, and re-use
	my own code; I find more errors, and spend less time fixing them; I trust my
	results more; I don't mind revisiting and revising old work; collaborators and
	potential employers are more impressed; and I'm happier.</p>

    <blockquote class="testimonial">
      <p>Software Carpentry helped me to explore the ways in which I improve and
	maintain my code. This made it easier for me to look back upon my old work and
	adapt it for new purposes, thereby making my research progress more
	quickly. It has also let me ask types of questions that I previously had no
	ability to address.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="testimonial">
      <p>I depend on the techniques taught in this course to maintain reliable
	programs, scripts and data organization. The time management, revision
	control, debugging and testing strategies are absolutely essential to build
	and maintain my projects. The basic Unix, shell, and scripting skills save me
	significant time and effort every day. It's an invaluable resource for
	computational researchers.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="testimonial">
      <p>While doing Software Carpentry, I made significant changes to the program I
	was using in my research. I felt like I was finally in control of its
	behavior, not vice versa. I still refer Software Carpentry to anyone new to
	programming, best practices, or even Python, especially if I have to work with
	that person.</p>
      <cite>&mdash; Elango Cheran's MSc thesis was on detecting structural variants from paired-end sequencing data</cite>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="testimonial">
      <p>Like most psychology students, I got no formal training in computational
	methods during my undergrad or graduate program. This meant that I was
	effectively cut off from the tool I was using and pessimistic about my chances
	of ever mastering it. Software Carpentry demystified programming for me and
	also gave me a solid background in software development practices. I now use
	tools that I never would have considered before taking the course, and have
	even accepted a postdoc in a computation-heavy lab, which would have been out
	of the question. My only regret is that I wasn't able to take this course
	earlier in my degree!</p>

    <blockquote class="testimonial">
      <p>Deadline after deadline: research life is as simple as that. As a
	consequence, research software is too often written in a rush. How many of you
	have faced that little, tricky, hidden bug a few days before submission? If
	you did, you also know that feeling of mistrust of your code. Software
	Carpentry showed me how easy and rewarding it is to write code that is
	testable from very early stages: write a little function, and immediately
	check whether simple examples yield the results you expect. And while
	Subversion repositories are not so easy to set up, once they are working, it's
	like having a perfect lab assistant to tell you what is going on at any
	time.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="testimonial">
      <p>Before I attended the Software Carpentry bootcamp, I honestly didn't think
	I'd pick up anything useful other than a few minor tips and tricks because I
	had been programming for over 6 years at that point. Much to my surprise,
	Software Carpentry transformed the way I approach programming. I learned how
	to write better, flexible software with command-line options; the importance
	of open-source, reusable software in research; and was introduced to the best
	research notebook I've encountered so far: IPython Notebook. I couldn't
	recommend Software Carpentry enough, even for the veteran programmers out
	there.</p>
