title: About Us

<p>
  Software Carpentry started in 1997,
  when <a href="{{page.root}}/pages/team.html#wilson.g">Greg Wilson</a> and Brent Gorda
  ran their first three-day course at <a href="http://www.lanl.gov">Los Alamos National Laboratory</a>.
  It received a major boost in 2004,
  when the <a href="http://www.python.org/psf/">Python Software Foundation</a> provided a grant
  to reorganize, update, and expand the material,
  and another in 2010 when Wilson left his position at the University of Toronto
  to teach Software Carpentry full-time,
  but really took off in 2012 thanks to backing from
  <a href="{{page.root}}/pages/sponsors.html#mozilla">Mozilla</a>
  and the <a href="{{page.root}}/pages/sponsors.html#sloan">Sloan Foundation</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Our mission is to teach researchers basic lab skills for scientific computing:
  the tools and techniques that will help them get more done in less time,
  and with less pain.
  Our core two-day curriculum includes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the Unix shell (and how to automate repetitive tasks);</li>
  <li>Python or R (and how to grow a program in a modular, testable way);</li>
  <li>Git and GitHub (and how to track and share work efficiently); and</li>
  <li>SQL (and the difference between structured and unstructured data).</li>
</ul>
<p>
  We now have over 100 qualified <a href="{{page.root}}/pages/team.html">instructors</a>,
  who ran over <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/past.html">100 events</a>
  for over 4300 scientists in a dozen countries in 2013.
