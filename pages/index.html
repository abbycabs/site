title: About Us
---
<p>
  Software Carpentry has been running in one form or another since 1997,
  when <a href="{{page.root}}/pages/team.html#wilson.g">Greg Wilson</a>
  and Brent Gorda (now at Intel)
  ran their first three-day course at <a href="http://www.lanl.gov">Los Alamos National Laboratory</a>.
  It received a major boost in 2004,
  when the <a href="http://www.python.org/psf/">Python Software Foundation</a> gave Wilson a grant
  to reorganize, update, and expand the material,
  and another in 2010 when Wilson left his position at the University of Toronto
  to teach Software Carpentry full-time,
  but really took off in 2012 thanks to backing from
  <a href="{{page.root}}/pages/sponsors.html#mozilla">Mozilla</a>
  and the <a href="{{page.root}}/pages/sponsors.html#sloan">Sloan Foundation</a>.
