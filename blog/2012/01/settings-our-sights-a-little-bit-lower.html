            <p>A couple of days ago, I <a href="/blog/2011/12/some-responses-to-some-comments.html">posted replies</a> to some of the comments that people had made on my posts about Software Carpentry's future. To recap, I want SC to:</p>
<ol>
<li>offer <a href="#content">learning materials</a> so that people can work through them on their own;</li>
<li>be a repository where people can <a href="#evolve">evolve those materials</a>;</li>
<li><a href="#coordinate">coordinate</a> people who are organizing live workshops, offering technical support [<a href="#1">1</a>], etc.; and</li>
<li>coordinate a distributed research program to <a href="#evaluate">evaluate Software Carpentry's effectiveness</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>It would be easier to achieve these four goals if we had <a href="/blog/2011/12/fork-merge-and-share.html">merge-friendly formats</a> for learning materials (both micro and macro), a large team of core content developers, and stable long-term financial support. Since we don't have any of those unicorns, what should we try to do in the next six months?</p>
<p id="content"><strong>Offer learning materials for self-directed use.</strong> If I was grading our existing content, I'd give it a weak B. While only a few episodes are outright failures from a teaching point of view, quite a few could use an overhaul based on learner feedback. What would make more difference, though, would be supplementing them with partially-worked examples, self-tests, and errata-style lists of common misconceptions and their corrections. I think it would take one person-month each to do this for our core topics (<a href="/v4/shell/">the shell</a>, <a href="/v4/vc/">version control</a>, <a href="/v4/python/">basic programming</a>, <a href="/v4/test/">testing</a>, <a href="/v4/setdict/">sets &amp; dictionaries</a>, and <a href="/v4/softeng/">software engineering</a>).</p>
<p id="evolve"><strong>Be a repository for evolving those materials.</strong> Anyone who wants our stuff can get it from our Subversion repository, but the "evolving" part is harder. I know a lot of groups have used our content, usually after some extensive tweaking to meet their particular needs. What I <em>don't</em> know is how to get them to give their material back&mdash;there isn't a "make, share, and remix" culture in teaching as their is in open source coding [<a href="#2">2</a>]. Absent any brilliant insights, I'm going to set this one aside for now.</p>
<p id="coordinate"><strong>Coordinate workshops.</strong> The inimitable <a href="http://homepages.cae.wisc.edu/~khuff/">Katy Huff</a> came up to Toronto in November to help us run a workshop, and there are a couple of others in the pipeline elsewhere. This is where I hope to make the biggest strides in the next six months: if all goes well, I will put out a call later this month for people to run workshops in their labs, schools, and workplaces this spring.</p>
<p id="evaluate"><strong>Evaluate Software Carpentry's effectiveness.</strong> This is easily the most important item in this post: without some reliable way to tell what's working and what isn't, improvement will be slow (and might not happen at all). I still don't understand why most software developers ignore most <a href="http://neverworkintheory.org/">empirical studies in sofware engineering</a>, but if we do organize a bunch of workshops this spring, I think we can also do some before-and-after questionnaires and interviews [<a href="#3">3</a>].</p>
<p>Of course, this would all be easier with your help&mdash;if you want to help out, please <a href="mailto:info@software-carpentry.org">get in touch</a>.</p>
<p id="1">[1] "Technical support" could be <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>-style Q&amp;A, but I think real-time desktop sharing with voiceover would be more helpful, since by definition, novices usually don't know what's important to describe and what isn't.</p>
<p id="2">[2] Lots of people (including me) Google for other teachers' slides when they're making up lessons of their own; what they don't do is send their hacks back to the original authors. There are exceptions, of course; I'm particularly interested in <a href="http://lessoncast.org/">LessonCast</a>, a site where teachers can share video tips about lessons and other ideas.</p>
<p id="3">[3] Perhaps modeled on the ones in <a href="/blog/2011/12/yet-another-survey.html">this paper</a>, but with more of an emphasis on human (development) time than computer (running) time..</p>
