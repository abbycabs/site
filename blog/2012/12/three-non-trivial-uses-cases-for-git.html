            <!-- start content -->
            <p><em>Today's guest post comes from <a href="http://limare.perso.math.cnrs.fr/">Nicolas Limare</a>.</em></p>

<p>Here are three problems I encountered while introducing fellow grad
students and post-docs to Git. These are situations where Git seems
not to provide the solution we need, either because it requires the
addition of an external service provider, unusual configuration
steps not adapted to beginners, or simply because the functionality
is missing in Git. Or maybe did I just ignore the perfect command or
option which would have answered all my wishes?</p>

<h2 id="simplecollaboration">1. Simple Collaboration</h2>

<p>Two or three people want to work together on a single repository, like
they are used to with Subversion. No branch, no pull request, no GitHub,
just a shared bare repo on the lab server, cloned and sync'd
onto everyone's own laptop via SSH. The problem is to allow proper
read/write permissions for everyone. Basic UNIX groups are not
practical, for example because they require to go through the local
sysadmin for every new project, and to define a new group per project.
In that case, my solution is to use POSIX extended ACLs:</p>

<pre>setfacl -Rm u:USER:rwX &#39;~/code/project.git&#39;
setfacl -Rm d:u:USER:rwX &#39;~/code/project.git&#39;
</pre>

<p>It is fairly clean, standard, and works perfectly, but these ACLs are
usually not enabled by default on filesystems and sysadmins may not
want to allow them. Moreover, non-admin users are not used to work
with this kind of permissions and having to touch them to collaborate
feels somehow abnormal.</p>

<h2 id="sharingbinarydata">2. Sharing Binary Data</h2>

<p>I had a group of students working on a shared dataset. One person
would produce the input data, and other persons would process them, in
chain, each with their own program. Everything is in a Git repo,
everyone's program is stored in source code and built with Make,
the data is processed in chain with Make too, and so far
everything is fine. But the input data is regularly updated, and it's
a hundred of 10 Mpixel JPEG images. So the size of the repository
quickly becomes quite heavy on everyone's machine (JPEG is already
compressed, and doesn't shrink any further in Git, and binary diff
of JPEG files is, or was, inefficient).</p>

<p>This huge weight is the problem. We want to keep the history and to be
able to go back to previous versions of the data, but we absolutely
don't want every one in the group to have on their own machine 25
different versions of a 100MB dataset. The solution may be
<code>git annex</code>, but it didn't exist at this time and it is not part of
the standard Git toolset. It's certainly also possible with <code>git
rebase</code> and <code>squash</code> every time the input data is updated, but this
git-fu is too complex for our simple needs. I want people to be
able to configure their local repo so that it only keeps less than a
configurable amount of data locally, something like a permanent
shallow clone.</p>

<h2 id="mirroring">3. Mirroring</h2>

<p>I was also trying to sell Git as a good solution to replicate files
between two machines, either for website or web app deployment, or to
maintain a workspace in different places. A sort of improved Rsync,
with diff transfers and the full history.</p>

<p>But to do that with Git, pushing updates from one machines to
another, the receiving repo needs to automatically perform a
checkout. This step requires some hook configuration (this is
non-trivial for beginners), and the checkout must be very carefully
configured to be performed at the right place, and to behave correctly
when some files need to be deleted or local changes overwritten. This
is too esoteric for a simple need.</p>
