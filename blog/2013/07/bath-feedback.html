<p>
This week saw Software Carpentry head to Bath in England's
South-West. The boot camp was organised by Alex Chartier, as part of
his role as a <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/fellowship-programme">fellow</a>
of <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk">The Software Sustainability Institute</a>.
Chris Woods from the University of Bristol, joined me
as co-instructor, making his boot camp instructing debut.
</p>
<!-- end excerpt -->
<p>
We had a range of helpers from across the UK: Elliot Marsden and Fergus
Cullen from The University of Edinburgh who'd attended the boot camp
we ran in Edinburgh last December; David Martin from The University of
Dundee; Jeremy Metz from The University of Exeter and Michael Croucher
(another Institute fellow) from The University of Manchester.
</p>
<p>
The attendees were primarily from the UK Meterological Office, the
Plymouth Marine Laboratory and from the universities of Bath, Bristol
and Liverpool. They included researchers into oceanography,
meterology, climate science, geosciences, environmental sciences,
earth sciences, with a few from biology/bioinformatics, electrical
engineering and computer science. About half of the attendees were PhD
students, the rest more senior researchers. Of the 25 we expected on
the day, we had just one no-show and we lost one after the first
day. This attendee found the level of technical knowledge assumed to
be too high. 
</p>
<p>
The round-the-room feedback was as follows...
</p>
<table class="table table-striped">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Good</th>
<th>Bad</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
Material very relevant, good that Git is now being used instead of
Mercurial. 
</td>
<td>
Python very good choice for introducing language topics but more
Pythonic aspects are sometimes missed out.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Online material on GitHub, can go back and repeat exercises.
(2).
</td>
<td>
Hard to cover Python for a range of abilities. Strongly recommend work
through Python tutorial before coming.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Testing cases and version control useful (2).
</td>
<td>
Morse example was good but there was a wide jump to programs and
architecture.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Online crib sheet useful during Python sessions for keeping track and
catching up if falling behind. But instructors could remind people
it's there.
</td>
<td>
Fast pace is good but if you miss a command you get lost (when
thinking). Keep things more visible on screen.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Helpers were most appreciated, a good number, they sit down with you
(2). 
</td>
<td>
Stickies kept falling off but principle is excellent. Just use the red
one if there's a problem? Make sure scripts remind instructors manage
sticky use.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Infrastructure good and useful.
</td>
<td>
VMs useful as for some organisations taking a laptop out can be very
problematic.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Refresh of shell commands was good if you don't use shell often.
</td>
<td>
A bit more on matplotlib would have been good, it was a bit tricky.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Make it clearer that some experience of coding is needed before
coming. Possibly have a pre-boot camp discussion or test. Promote
content earlier and which days/sessions are most suitable for which
expertise levels.
</td>
<td>
Pace sometimes a bit quick. 
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Really friendly, hard-working attendees, good atmosphere.
</td>
<td>
Sessions overran and there weren't enough breaks when needed ("break
management").
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Classroom based course is useful. Share space and discuss with other
people outwith the actual course content. Advantage over online
teaching.
</td>
<td>
Offer it at different at different levels and abilities (2).
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Well-structured content, could be rolled out to A level students (with
a bit of restructuring) to get them early.
</td>
<td>
Future courses could be focused on one specific area e.g. Python.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Great!
</td>
<td>
Feedback session a bit long!
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
In respect of the pace, we did a quick poll and about half the
attendees couldn't justify being away for more than 2 days.
</p>
<p>
As an instructor, things I learned this time round included:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
To try and remember to use the stickies, in particular to get
attendees to put up red stickies by default at the start of any
exercise.
</li>
<li>
That CTRL-R allows me to search the shell history :-)
</li>
<li>
That yellow stickies were useful for helping to demonstrate conflicts
in Git, "attendees with a yellow sticky now do this..."
</li>
<li>
A pictorial representation of how exceptions work would have been
useful.
</li>
<li>
An air-conditioned room is a must-have when doing boot camps at the
height of summer (though some attendees felt it was a bit chilly!) 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In September, Chris will be instructing on our boot camp in
<a href="../../../bootcamps/2013-09-12-bristol/index.html">Bristol</a>,
and in November Chris, Jeremy and David will reunite to help deliver 
our boot camp in
<a href="../../../bootcamps/2013-11-exeter.html">Exeter</a>.
