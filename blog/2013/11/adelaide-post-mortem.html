<p>
  We ran our first bootcamp at the University of
  Adelaide from the 24th to the 26th of September 2013. Teachers and
  helpers came from all over the place: Ben Morris from the University of
  North Carolina acted as Principal Instructor, along with Jerico Revote
  from Monash University, Diego Barneche from Macquarie University,
  Philipp Bayer from the University of Queensland, Nicholas Crouch from Flinders University, 
  and Nathan Watson-Haigh from the Australian Centre for Plant Functional Genomics (ACPFG), who
  also acted as the main organizer (thanks for that!).
</p>
<!-- end excerpt -->
<h2>Venue</h2>
<p>
  The bootcamp was held in a "collaborative teaching suite" in the
  Ingkarni Wardli building at the University of Adelaide, a great room for
  this kind of workshop - lots of space, an overkill of projectors so that
  every corner could see what was going on on the instructor's workspace,
  *plus* monitors displaying the instructor's workspace on every
  group-table. Since students used remote Virtual Machines there were no
  problems with setting up software or anything else - using VMs is
  something to come back to in future workshops, since the VMs saved the
  hassle of getting all needed software running on all participants'
  machines. This saved half a day, not to speak of sanity.
</p>
<h2>Topics</h2>
<p>
  Since the workshop was primarily for NGS bioinformaticians, Python was
  chosen as the main language. Along with an introduction to Python (which
  was cut short by a fire-alarm, no time for modules in Python), there was
  a short introduction to documentation, half a day on the principles of
  testing, a few hours on using make-files for reproducible research, and
  most importantly, an introduction to version control and collaborative
  work using Git and GitHub. For the first time (at least known to me),
  this workshop also featured a group-exercise at the end, which was only
  possible for two reasons: 1) this workshop ran for three days instead of 
  the usual two; 2) most students were already used to programming in
  at least another language (e.g. C, Python, Perl). I was particularly impressed
  with the group-exercise, first because most students incorporated their own ideas
  and work, and second because students immediately started to incorporate
  everything they learned, from make-files to using GitHub to collaborate.
</p>
<p>
  Luckily, most of the students were on roughly the same level when it
  came to prior knowledge, so we didn't have to split up the groups into
  "beginners" and "advanced".
</p>
<h2>Outcomes</h2>
<p>
  In the end, I think the workshop went well and students learned a lot -
  I base this assumption mostly on the way students applied their newly
  minted knowledge during the group exercise. Also, we asked 
  students to provide feedback immediately after each session, and,
  overall, comments were very positive.
</p>
<h2>Some Conclusions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    VMs are extremely useful: software can be set up in advance, there's
    no headache with Windows/Linux differences etc. The downside: It's a bit
    more of a hassle to get files to students after the workshop (Nathan
    zipped all home-directories and sent them around, and students were
    encouraged to upload the work they wanted to keep to their new
    GitHub-accounts).
  </li>
  <li>
    There needs to be more material on Documentation, or maybe merge this
    with a general "Best practices in programming" topic? Then you can also
    include things like naming conventions, KISS etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    Group exercises are fun and, I think, a good way for students to try
    out their new knowledge and have the chance to clean any misconceptions
    with instructors before students go back home. However, a third day is needed
    which might not always be possible.
  </li>
  <li>
    Whenever possible, a 3-day workshop is better? 4 days is probably overkill.
  </li>
</ul>
