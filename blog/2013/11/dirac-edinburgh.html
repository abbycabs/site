            <!-- start content -->

<p>
My colleague Mike Jackson recently posted about the <a
href="../../../blog/2013/07/dirac-roll-out.html">DiRAC driving
test</a>. DiRAC is the UK's integrated supercomputing facility for
theoretical modelling and HPC-based research in particle physics,
astronomy and cosmology and is used by numerous researchers with
diverse backgrounds. Whilst much of their work is very different, one
commonality is that it often requires in-depth technical and software
engineering techniques. The idea of the driving test was therefore to
ensure that all users have the required knowledge for effective use of
the consortium's machines.
</p>  
<!-- end excerpt -->
<p>
The test aims to illustrate and address any gaps in user knowledge. It
follows a self-taught, open book approach and as part of this,
Software Carpentry has produced some detailed support material which
is given to the candidates in advance. It was always intended to be
mandatory for all DiRAC users and as such it was critically important
that the team designing the test got it right.
</p>
<p>
Earlier in the year the test was put through four dry runs at EPCC and
at UCL to ensure that it was fit for purpose. Based upon the success
of these dry runs, the <a href="http://www.dirac.ac.uk/">DiRAC
consortium</a> gave it the 'green light' in July with the initial
batch of user tests to be completed in the later part of 2013. 
</p>
<h2>Taking the test in Edinburgh</h2>
<p>
In all, seven institutes run the driving test with the idea being that
users will travel to their nearest centre to complete the exam. I was
given the task of administering the driving test here in Edinburgh and
last week saw our first run, with fifteen users from across
Scotland. The test itself, lasting between one and two hours depending
on previous experience, covers aspects such as version control, shell
scripting, testing strategies and basic coding. We had researchers
from all sorts of backgrounds: mathematicians to computer scientists
to physicists.
</p>
<p>
Whilst a number of candidates did not have experience in some of the
areas, using the supporting material they were able to answer the
questions to a high standard. I am pleased to say that everyone in
Edinburgh completed the test in plenty of time and all passed.
</p>
<p>
The feedback from the Edinburgh users so far has been overwhelmingly
positive. The majority have said that it is relevant to their everyday
work; all have said that the supporting material was useful and, based
upon this, most said that they learnt something from doing the test
itself. The Institute has produced detailed comments about each
question that I used as the basis for feedback to the candidates and,
from my own perspective, it was very interesting to see how people
from different backgrounds tackled the questions.
</p>
<h2>Missed out?</h2>
<p>
We will be running another Edinburgh-based DiRAC driving test in early
2014. If you wish to sign up to it then you can do so via <a
href="http://www.dirac.ac.uk/training.html">DiRAC's training
website</a>. If you are not a DiRAC user but would still like to
understand the material, then you can access the <a
href="../../../v4/index.html">Software Carpentry lessons</a>.
</p>
<p>
The DiRAC driving test was developed by<a
href="http://www.software.ac.uk/"> The Software Sustainability
Institute</a> in conjunction with Greg Wilson of Software
Carpentry, James Hetherington of <a
href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/">UCL</a>, <a
href="http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk">EPCC</a>'s Andrew Turner, and Jeremy
Yates and Harpreet Dhanoa of the <a
href="http://www.dirac.ac.uk">DiRAC consortium</a>.
