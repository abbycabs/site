            <p>Three months
  after <a href="/blog/2012/11/workshop-for-high-energy-physics-at-ucl.html">part
  1</a>, the second half of the UCL Software Carpentry workshop for
  High-Energy Physics took place on Friday 15th February 2013.
</p>

<p>The experimental format with two sessions three months apart might
  have worked better if, as envisaged, we had managed to get an online
  discussion going in the gap. Unfortunately this did not work
  out. Despite several attempts at chasing up the participants, no-one
  registered or posted anything on the course web site. After talking
  to some of the students, I think their interest was just not great
  enough to overcome the bureaucracy involved in registering on the
  UCL Moodle server and the tendency to focus on their other
  (assessed) courses and research projects. Attendance was down from
  65% to 30% (6 of 20 students), although those who did attend were
  clearly motivated, worked hard and asked thoughtful questions. With
  two helpers (James Hetherington and HEP postgrad Sam Cook) and
  myself as instructor, we had a student:staff ratio of 2:1.</p>

<p>Most of the morning session was spent getting back to where we were
  at the end of part 1, with various technical problems needing to be
  solved all over again. Surprisingly, everyone came back after lunch
  and the afternoon session was, I think, rather more
  successful. Taking advantage of the small student numbers, we
  divided the class into two teams of three, and set them to work on
  different parts of the same code base. One team wrote code to
  retrieve a list of particle four-momenta from a collision event,
  while the other team worked on generating a list of
  oppositely-charged pairs from a list of particles.
</p>

<p>Due in part to the nature of their tasks and the input they had to
  work with, the first team took a fairly ad-hoc approach to testing
  their code, while the second wrote a fairly comprehensive set of
  unit tests. In between iterations (of about 20 minutes each) they
  talked about what they had done and what problems they had
  encountered, and after each iteration they pushed their code to the
  shared repository on GitHub, merging their changes where needed.
</p>

<p>During the last half hour I pulled the merged code
  from both teams into my local repository and used a separate Git
  branch (based on my own version of the code) to plot the results.
  Then I rushed through a
  list of topics we had not managed to cover, including testing
  floating-point numbers.</p>

<p>While there is a lot more material I would have liked to cover, and
  could perhaps have covered by imposing a more rigid structure on the
  event, I
  suspect that the most effective learning experience was the rather
  chaotic extended exercise in collaborative code development. What I
  would like to do next year is find a way to scale this up to what I
  hope will be a larger class.</p>
