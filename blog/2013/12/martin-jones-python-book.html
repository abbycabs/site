  When I was writing <cite>Python for Biologists</cite>
  (see my <a href="../../../blog/2013/10/python-for-biologists.html">previous guest post</a>)
  I was extremely ruthless about leaving material out. I wanted the book
  to cover pretty much the same set of language features that I teach in
  my instructor-led introductory programming courses, which meant I had
  to limit the scope of the book to what an average, motivated beginner
  could take in in a full-time week of study. This restriction meant
  that, while I think the overall balance of material in Python for
  Biologists is still the most useful set for novice programmers, there
  are big topics that didn't make the cut. There's no mention of
  object-oriented or functional programming, nothing about Python's
  extremely elegant comprehension syntax, and nothing on recursion. As I
  was writing, I made a list of all these omissions, with the promise to
  myself that I would write about them some day.
</p>
<!-- end excerpt -->
<p>
  Recently, a couple of things have been co-incidentally happening at
  the same time that have got me thinking again about the importance of
  exploring a programming language beyond the basics. Firstly, I've been
  writing the follow-up to <cite>Python for Biologists</cite> (it's called,
  unsurprisingly, Advanced Python for Biologists, and you can read about
  it <a href="http://pythonforbiologists.com/index.php/advanced-python-for-biologists/">here</a>)
  and I've found myself concentrating on the chapters that discuss
  different approaches to programming: object-oriented programming,
  functional programming, and recursion. Secondly, I've been watching my
  current class of students make the conceptual leap from procedural to
  object-oriented programming in the MSc course on which I teach. Both
  of these things have left me thinking about the important role that
  knowledge of a programming language plays in determining how people
  solve computational problems.
</p>
<p>
  For the new book, I've started each chapter by laying out a problem
  and showing how to solve it using procedural code, before showing an
  alternative, better solution that involve
  object-oriented/functional/recursive programming. What strikes me
  forcibly in each case is not only the degree to which the
  object-oriented/functional/recursive solutions are better, but how
  simply knowing that such techniques exist open up a whole new approach
  to problem-solving. Recursive functions are great for processing
  tree-like data, for example, but it's unlikely that anyone would come
  up with them without having been explicitly introduced to recursion.
  This isn't because the concept is especially hard to grasp&mdash;it's just
  that recursive solutions simply aren't part of the conceptual toolbox
  of a procedurally-trained programmer. The same goes for higher-order
  functions: they allow us to solve certain sets of problems very
  elegantly, but in a way that's completely non-obvious to someone who
  hasn't been taught about functional abstraction. And, as the examples
  of code I see from my students makes clear, switching from procedural
  to object-oriented code (which makes some types of problems much
  easier to solve) requires changing the way we think about state.
</p>
<p>
  In a way, this line of thought is a programmer's version of the
  Sapir-Whorf hypothesis: the idea from linguistics which posits that
  the structure of the language you speak affects your mental model of
  the world. Not being a linguist, I don't know how the Sapir-Whorf
  hypothesis (Wikipedia tells me that it is know known as "linguistic
  relativism") is currently viewed as applied to natural languages, but
  as a instructor, I definitely think that it applies very well to
  programming languages. If the language you know and use (or rather:
  the subset of features in that language that you know and use) doesn't
  include classes, first-class functions, or recursion, then those
  approaches to looking at and solving problems are unlikely to be at
  your disposal.
</p>
<p>
  That's why I'm currently concentrating on writing about advanced
  Python features for use in biological analyses&mdash;including object
  orientation, higher-order functions, and recursion. If a programmer
  never goes beyond the basics then they're not just missing out on
  language features that could make life easier, they're missing out on
  entire ways of thinking about problems and their solutions.
  Incidentally, this is part of the reason that I'm a big fan of Python
  as a first language for teaching. It allows (but does not enforce)
  object-oriented and functional approaches to problem-solving, and the
  syntax for each is lightweight enough to allow the student to
  concentrate on the structure of code rather than the specifics.
</p>
<p>
  So if you're comfortable with the basics of programming&mdash;and maybe
  you've already written a fair few useful programs&mdash;I encourage you to
  seek out the corners of your programming language that you haven't yet
  ventured into. With any luck, what you'll find there is not just new
  features, but new ways of thinking.
