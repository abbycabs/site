* Please ensure that Box 1 is referenced in the text 

Reference added to final paragraph of introduction.

* Please ensure that all author names are written in full on the title page - you currently have one author listed as D. Aruliah. All author names must be in full, and how authors want them presented in the published article and indexed in PubMed.

Dhavide prefers to publish under his initials as "D. A. Aruliah", but I have modified the paper as requested.  All other names are in full (I presume you do *not* need full middle names?).

* Please remove all footnotes - you still currently have footnotes at the bottom of some of your article pages. Please incorporate this information in the running text. 

My apologies, this has been corrected.

* Please move the acknowledgements section of the article to the end of the article file, after the references and before Box 1, ensuring that all financial information remains removed from this section and instead inserted, as you have currently, in the financial disclosure section of the submissions system.

Done.
