1. AUTHOR BLURB

We describe a set of best practices for scientific software
development that have solid foundations in research and experience,
and that improve scientists' productivity and the reliability of their
software.

* We note the involvement of Dr Greg Wilson (as part of the Mozilla
  Science Labs team) in the ongoing code review project with PLOS
  Computational Biology. As this may be perceived as a potential
  conflict of interest, please supply a statement of your relationship
  to PLOS Computational Biology as a "Statement of Competing
  Interests".

Updated.

* Please remove the numbers from the subheads; in retrospect we think
  that these don't work. Fine to leave them in 'Reference/Box 1'.

Done.

* Please provide a blurb as detailed above.

Added.
 
* Richard Guy has not confirmed his authorship. I have resent the
  confirmation email to him which includes links for him to click and
  confirm. Please note that we cannot proceed until all authors have
  confirmed in our system.

He has now confirmed.

* Please ensure that all authors are listed in the article file as
  they wish their names to be published and indexed in PubMed,
  including all middle initials. Please also ensure that the author
  names match in the submissions system and the article file.

Done.

* Please move the acknowledgements section to the end of the article
  file, removing the financial information from this section. Your
  financial disclosure will be pulled in automatically from the
  Financial Disclosure section of the submission form and must not be
  duplicated. Please therefore ensure that all your funding
  information is present in this section of the form, and does not
  omit any information.

I am unsure what "end of the article file" means --- I have put it
after the \end{document} so that it does not appear in the text.
Please let me know if this is incorrect.  For reference, the
information is:

    Neil Chue Hong was supported by the UK Engineering and Physical
    Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Grant EP/H043160/1 for the UK
    Software Sustainability Institute.

    Ian M. Mitchell was supported by NSERC Discovery Grant #298211.

    Mark Plumbley was supported by EPSRC through a Leadership
    Fellowship (EP/G007144/1) and a grant (EP/H043101/1) for
    SoundSoftware.ac.uk.

* Please give full details of author institutions on the title page,
  including country.

Done.

* Please change the file type for the pdf version of your manuscript
  to 'Related Manuscript'.

Done.

* Please rename the 'Reference' section 'Box 1' and cite this in the
  text accordingly.

Done.
 
* Please remove the footnotes and either include them in the running
  text, or include them as references (renumbering as necessary to
  ensure all references remain in ascending numerical order).

Done.  This has introduced one line spillage, and one hyphenation in
a URL --- please let me know if I should take further steps.
 
* Please remove the Abstract heading and instead place the abstract
  text as the first paragraph of the Introduction.

Done.
