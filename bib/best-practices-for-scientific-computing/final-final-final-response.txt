* Page 6, Para 2 - you have removed the section numbers, as requested,
  but have left blank spaces in the bracketed in text
  references. Please either remove these references or replace the
  section numbers that have been removed with other information.

The first reference to a section number (page 4, para 2) has been
changed to "in the first section", and the two references on page 6
have been removed.

* We notice that the text from footnote 10 that you removed, as
  requested, has not appeared anywhere else in the text. If this was
  your intension, this is fine, but we wanted to check this has not
  inadvertently been left out.

The text was deliberately removed: there was no easy way to fit it
into the main text, and upon re-reading, it wasn't essential.

There is one further change: I spoke with Prof. Aruliah, and he
strongly prefers to appear as "D. A. Aruliah" (which is how he appears
elsewhere in the literature).  I have accordingly reverted the change
in the author list at the start of the paper.
