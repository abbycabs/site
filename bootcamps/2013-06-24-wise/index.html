  <h3>Schedule</h3>

  <p>
    After looking at the results of the survey you all filled
    out, we decided that to make the bootcamp most effective for
    everyone we would divide you into three rooms, roughly based
    on level of experience. Rooms will cover the same general
    material, just at slightly different paces or level of
    detail. You will receive an email letting you know which
    room you will be in. You can go to the schedule for that
    room below. (Keep in mind that the schedule is still being
    updated.)
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="room1.html">Room 1: Novice</a></li>
    <li><a href="room2.html">Room 2: Intermediate</a></li>
    <li><a href="room3.html">Room 3: Advanced</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Coffee and Food</h3>

  <p>
    Coffee and snacks will be provided during the workshop.
    Lunch will not be provided, but there are several local
    areas where you can get food during the lunch break.
  </p>

  <h3>Reception</h3>

  <p>
    There will be a reception and dinner sponsored by JP Morgan
    at One Cambridge Center (the bootcamp location) after the
    first day of class (Monday June 24).  The reception lasts
    from 5:00&ndash;7:00pm and is open to all participants. The
    reception will also include a panel on resources, careers
    and opportunities in technology as well as time to
    talk/network with instructors, helpers and other
    participants.
  </p>

<div id="install" class="row-fluid">

  <h2>Installation</h2>

  <p>
    To complete the entire workshop you need several things: a
    Bash shell, Git, a code editor (though any plain text editor
    will work in a pinch), SQL, and a scientific Python
    installation that includes the
    <a href="http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/htmlnotebook.html">IPython Notebook</a>,
    <a href="http://numpy.scipy.org/">NumPy</a>,
    and <a href="https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">nose</a>.
    With these tools, your computer will be ready for a wide
    variety of scientific computing tasks. One of our goals in
    this workshop is to help you get these cutting-edge programs
    installed so you can focus on science in the future, not
    installation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Please do your best to install all the required software
    and potentially the virtual machine (explained below) prior
    to the start of the boot camp. If you have any issues, we
    will be available at the bootcamp location starting at
    8:30 a.m. Monday to help set up your machine.
  </p>

  <div class="row-fluid">
    <div class="span6">
        <h4>Bash</h4>

        <p>
          Bash is a commonly-used shell. Using a shell gives you
          more power to do more tasks more quickly with your
          computer.
        </p>

        <h5>Mac</h5>

        <p>
          The default shell in all versions of Mac OS X is bash,
          so no need to install anything.  You access bash from
          the Terminal (found
          in <code>/Applications/Utilities</code>).  You may want
          to keep Terminal in your dock for this workshop.
        </p>

        <h5>Windows</h5>

        <p>
          Install <a href="http://msysgit.github.com/">Git Bash</a>
          following <a href="https://openhatch.org/missions/windows-setup/install-git-bash">these instructions</a>.
          This gives you the Bash shell plus Git.
        </p>

        <h5>Linux</h5>

        <p>
          The default shell is usually bash but if not you can
          get to bash by opening a terminal and
          typing <code>bash</code>.  No need to install
          anything.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="span6">
        <h4>Code Editor</h4>

        <p>
          When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text
          editor that is optimized for writing code, with features
          like automatic color-coding of key words.
        </p>

        <h5>Mac</h5>

        <p>
          We recommend
          <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">Text Wrangler</a> or
          <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>.
        </p>

        <h5>Windows</h5>

        <p>
          <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> is a
          popular free code editor for Windows.
        </p>

        <h5>Linux</h5>

        <p>
          <a href="http://kate-editor.org/">Kate</a> is one option for
          Linux users.
        </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="row-fluid">
    <div class="span6">
        <h4>Python</h4>

        <p>
          Python is becoming more and more popular in scientific
          computing, and it's a great language for teaching
          general programming concepts due to its easy-to-read
          syntax. We will be using Python version 2.7.  Installing
          all the scientific packages for Python individually can
          be a bit difficult, so we recommend using an all-in-one
          installer.
        </p>

        <h5>Mac &amp; Linux</h5>

        <p>
          We recommend the all-in-one scientific Python installer
          <a href="http://continuum.io/downloads.html">Anaconda</a>.
          Installation requires using the shell and if you aren't
          comfortable doing the installation yourself just
          download the installer and we'll help you at the boot
          camp.  If you want to give it a try, do the
          following:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Download the installer that matches your operating
            system and save it in your home folder.
          </li>
          <li>
            Open a terminal window. On the Mac, the Terminal is
            in <code>/Applications/Utilities</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Type <pre>bash Anaconda-</pre> and then press
            tab. The name of the file you just downloaded should
            appear.
          </li>
          <li>
            Press enter. You will follow the text-only
            prompts. When there is a colon at the bottom of the
            screen press the down arrow to move down through the
            text. Type <code>yes</code> and press enter to approve
            the license. Press enter to approve the default
            location for the files. Type <code>yes</code> and
            press enter to prepend Anaconda to
            your <code>PATH</code> (this makes the Anaconda
            distribution the default Python).
          </li>
          <li>
            Done!
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Windows</h5>

        <p>
          For Windows we recommend the Enthought
          <a href="https://www.enthought.com/downloads/">Canopy</a>
          distribution since it seems to work well with Git
          Bash.
        </p>

        <p>
          For other options check the Python4Astronomers page on
          <a href="http://python4astronomers.github.com/installation/python_install.html">installing scientific Python</a>.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="span6">
        <h4>Git</h4>

        <p>
          Git is a state-of-the-art version control system. It
          lets you track who made changes to what when and has
          options for easily updating a shared or public version of
          your code on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>.
        </p>

        <h5>Mac</h5>

        <p>
          For git, for the Anacoda version of Python (see below),
          and for a lot of other scientific computing software,
          Mac users need a C compiler on their computer. The way
          to get that is to install
          <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode</a>.
        </p>

        <h6>For Mac OS X 10.7 and 10.8:</h6>

        <p>
          Go to the
          <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode website</a>.
          Get XCode from the App Store making
          certain to install the command line tools (from the
          Download preferences pane). Git is included in the
          command line tools.
        </p>

        <h6>For Mac OS X 10.6</h6>

        <p>
          If you have Mac OS X 10.6, first get XCode by going to
          <a href="https://developer.apple.com/downloads/">the Apple developer site</a>.
          You have to sign in with an
          Apple ID linked to a Developer account.  If you don't
          have one, you can register and create one. Then, once you log in, go to page 8 and find
          "XCode 3.2.6 and iOS SDK 4.3 for Snow Leopard" near the
          top. Click to open that section, and then download the
          .dmg file. It's 4.14 Gb, so leave some time to download
          this one. Then,
          <a href="http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/downloads/list?can=3">install just git</a>.
        </p>

        <h5>Windows</h5>

        <p>
          Install <a href="http://msysgit.github.com/">Git Bash</a>
          following the instructions
          <a href="https://openhatch.org/missions/windows-setup/install-git-bash">here</a>
          if you haven't already.
        </p>

        <h5>Linux</h5>

        <p>
          If git is not already available on your machine you can try
          to install it via your distro's package manager
          (e.g. <code>apt-get</code>).
        </p>

        <h4>SQL</h4>

        <p>
          SQL (pronounced Es-Cue-El) is a
          language for accessing data that meets certain
          characterists from databases.
        </p>

        <p>
          The easiest way to use SQL is to install
          the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/">SQLite Manager</a>
          plugin for Firefox
          (which naturally requires you to have Firefox).
